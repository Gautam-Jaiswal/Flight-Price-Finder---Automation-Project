# Flight-Price-Finder---Automation-Project
A selenium based python automation project in which flight price is grabbed and filled in an google forum provided which then is taken to an excel sheet

# Bugs
1. Input date is not checked and so if user enters something wrong date or enters a date 5-6 months ahead of current date,it will raise an error and not print a message like input error or something.
2. Flight Input is Hard-Coded and so we need to take input in it and check wether it's a valid input or not and also check wehter a flight exsists between them or not
